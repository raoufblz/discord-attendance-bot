## Usage: (in developement ðŸ”¨ðŸ”¨)

- creates a text channel to log the pagination to, even if deleted it recreates it.

## Command documentation: (in developement ðŸ”¨ðŸ”¨)
- every command is now a slash command (Discord's prefered way).
- the commands have role-based access; only those with specefic roles can use them.

  
- /join: makes the bot enter the voice channel you re in.
- /leave: the bot leaves the voice channel, you need to be in the vc for it to work,
    it calculates the time spent by each member and logs it.
- /list: logs real-time voice data in a channel the bot creates.
- /help: a command that lists all available commands and what they do.
- /reset_data: deletes all past voice data and restarts tracking.
